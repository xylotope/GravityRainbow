#Rainbow Gravity

This is a simple little game that I built for a challenge to build a game in one week.
The game is not very polished, but I think it could be a good start to a decent game if it gets some more work.

The challenge was to design and build a game in one week.  All assets, such as images, models, and sounds were all created from scratch for this game; no outside assets allowed.

The ball is continually falling and the player can tap the rainbow colored circles to apply a force to the ball that is proportional to the distance the ball is from the circle.  Using these forces, the player is supposed to push the ball as high as they can without dropping it.

The game currently needs to be played on a phone or tablet.  It was not designed to be played on computers and doesn't have the code built in to do so, although it wouldn't be too difficult to add that in.
